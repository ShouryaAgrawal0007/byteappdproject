# APP DEV task journey
I am Shourya Agrawal, a 2nd year Btech CSE student. 
I am a beginner in field of technologies. 
After thinking I decided that I had a little interest in app development . So I started it from the scratch downloading Android Studio and learning about XML and kotlin . After a little bit of knowledge ,I explored how to get Maps in my app in which I faced unwilling errors.

So, I have only done some of the changes in manifest,gradle files and imported packages .So in the given timespan I have completed a little bit of the task in which I am facing errors .
